Data Mining Projects

In this Assignment, you need to implement three algorithms from scratch :

Algorithm (a) : K-means (Initialize k cluster centers by randomly picking up k points among all data points in the dataset).

Algorithm (b) : A clustering technique of distributing all the data-points in the dataset into k groups (clusters) such that diameter of the largest cluster is minimum among all possible ways of creating k clusters out of these data-points (Diameter = Euclidean distance between the two farthest points in a cluster).

Algorithm (c) : Spectral-Clustering (Use a Gaussian kernel for computing affinity score between two points. Use k-nearest neighbor for graph construction (set k=5). You may use libraries for sub-tasks in spectral-clustering, for example- computing diagonal Degree matrix, Eigen-vectors & Eigen-values).

Task 1)
Implement Algorithms (a), (b) and (c) on Dataset-1 ( ‘Dataset_1.csv’ contains 3 columns - 1st, 2nd columns represent features and 3rd column represents class information for each observation). Set number of clusters = 2.

Generate the following plots :
(i) Plot all the data values (first 2 columns of ‘Dataset_1.csv’) as points in a 2-Dimensional space. Represent them in different colors according to their class labels.
(ii) Plot the clustered results. Total number of plots = 3 (1 plot for each algorithm).

Deliverables :

[1] Code.[2] 4 Plots.

Task 2)
Implement Algorithms (a), (b) and (c) on Dataset-2 ( ‘Dataset_2.csv’ contains 3 columns - 1st, 2nd columns represent features and 3rd column represents class information for each observation). Set number of clusters = 2.

Generate the following plots :
(i) Plot all the data values (first 2 columns of ‘Dataset_2.csv’) as points in a 2-Dimensional space. Represent them in different colors according to their class labels.
(ii) Plot the clustered results. Total number of plots = 3 (1 plot for each algorithm).

Which algorithm gave the worst performance? Why.

Task 3)

Generate the following plots :
(i) Plot all the data values (first 2 columns of ‘Dataset_3.csv’) as points in a 2-Dimensional space. Represent them in different colors according to their class labels.

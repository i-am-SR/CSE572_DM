Task 1)
Naïve-Bayes Classifier

In this classification problem, you are required to train a Naïve-Bayes classifier that predicts whether a person is male (represented as 0) or female (represented as 1), given three features: height (in centi-meters), age and weight (in kilograms).
Use “PB1_train.csv” and “PB1_test.csv” for this task, where the first three columns represent three features (height, age, weight), and the fourth column represent class label (0/1). Train a Naïve-Bayes classifier NV on “PB1_train.csv” data that learns to map the mentioned features to their corresponding class values.

Report the predicted values (y?) and accuracy percentage (percentage of matches) of the model NV by testing it on “PB1_test.csv” data.

[1] Accuracy (in percentage) ,[2] Predicted Values (y?) on “PB1_test.csv”.

Task 2)

SVM Classifier

Use “PB1_train.csv” and “PB1_test.csv” for this task. Train three SVM classifiers SV1, SV2 and SV3 on “PB1_train.csv” data that learns to map the mentioned features to their corresponding class values. Report the predicted values (y?) and accuracy percentage (percentage of matches) for each model by testing it on “PB1_test.csv” data.

SV1 configuration: kernel type = 'linear'.
SV2 configuration: kernel type = 'polynomial', Degree of the polynomial kernel function = 5.
SV3 configuration: kernel type = ‘radial basis function’ or 'rbf'.

[1] Accuracies (in percentage),[2] Predicted Values (y?) on “PB1_test.csv” for each model.

Task 3)

Naïve-Bayes Classifier
Use “PB2_train.csv” and “PB2_test.csv” for this task, where the first three columns represent three features (height, age, weight), and the fourth column represent class label (0/1). Train a Naïve-Bayes classifier NV on “PB2_train.csv” data that learns to map the mentioned features to their corresponding class values.

Report the predicted values (y?) and accuracy percentage (percentage of matches) of the model NV by testing it on “PB2_test.csv” data.

[1] Accuracy (in percentage),[2] Predicted Values (y?) on “PB2_test.csv”.

Task 4)

SVM Classifier
Use “PB2_train.csv” and “PB2_test.csv” for this task. Train three SVM classifiers SV1, SV2 and SV3 on “PB2_train.csv” data that learns to map the mentioned features to their corresponding class values. Report the predicted values (y?) and accuracy percentage (percentage of matches) for each model by testing it on “PB2_test.csv” data.
SV1 configuration: kernel type = 'linear'.
SV2 configuration: kernel type = 'polynomial', Degree of the polynomial kernel function = 7.
SV3 configuration: kernel type = ‘radial basis function’ or 'rbf'.


[1] Accuracies (in percentage),[2] Predicted Values (y?) on “PB2_test.csv” for each model.
